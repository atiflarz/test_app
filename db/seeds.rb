# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# 100.times do |u|
#  user = User.create(email: Faker::Internet.email, password: '111111', password_confirmation: '111111')
#  organization = user.create_organization(org_name: Faker::Address.city)
#  profile = organization.create_profile(first_name:Faker::Artist.name, last_name: Faker::Artist.name)
#  address = organization.create_address(line1: Faker::Address.street_name, line2: Faker::Address.street_address, state: Faker::Address.state, city: Faker::Address.city, zip: Faker::Number.number(6),country: Faker::Address.country )
# end
